<h3> Task 2: Chi-square analysis </h3>
<p>
     Now that you think you know which company is fair or not, 
     conduct a hypothesis test to determine if there is evidence 
     that supports your claims. On this page, the same simulation 
     is presented but this time you will noticed that there is a 
     red line across the graph of the dice rolls. This line 
     indicates what we should expect to see happen if the dice 
     selected are fair. Below this graph is a chi-square distribution. 
     You will see plotted on this distribution the test statistic 
     generated from a goodness of fit test. The graph also 
     indicates if the test statistic is in the rejection region or not. 
     The actual values of the test statistic and p-value are presented 
     below the frequency table. For this investigation complete 
     the following:
</p>

<ol>

    <li> Test the hypothesis you generated on the first page using the same simulation values. Did you reject or not? </li>
    <li> Investigate what role the sample size has on the test statistic and p-value.
    
        <ol>
            <li> For a company that you thought was fair, test using a sample size of 10, 50, 100, and 1000. Did the test reach the same conclusion each time? </li>
            <li> For a company that you thought was not fair, test using a sample size of 10, 50, 100 ,and 1000. Did the test reach the same conclusion each time? </li>
            <li> What relationship is there between the sample size and the test statistic? </li>
        </ol>
    
    </li>
</ol>
