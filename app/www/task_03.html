  
<h3>Task 3: Power</h3>

<p>
    A hypothesis test is only as good as the sample used. A hypothesis test is 
    not perfect. It tries to make the correct decision but when the difference 
    between the null hypothesis and the truth are small it makes it hard for
    the hypothesis test to reach the correct conclusion. We can evaluate how 
    well a specific hypothesis test will do under specified alternatives by 
    investigating the power of the test. The power of the test is the ability 
    of a hypothesis test to correctly reject a false null. For this 
    investigation you will determine the power of the goodness of fit test to 
    detect the companies not making fair dice.

<p>
    On this page you will see the distribution of the dice produced by each 
    company and you can clearly see that all but one company was producing fair 
    dice. In this simulation you can selecte a company, choose a sample size to 
    roll the dice with, and then repeat that roll a set number of times. The 
    simulation will note each time the simulation runs the test statistic and 
    plot it on the graph. In all instances the test should produce a test 
    statistic that rejects the null hypothesis. The power which is calculated 
    below the graph indicates the percent of times that the simulation correctly 
    rejected the null hypothesis.

<p>
    For this investigation choose a company and evaluate how different sample 
    sizes effect the power of the test.
</p>

<ol>
    <li> Choose a company that is close to being fair, what size sample is needed for the power to be near 90%? </li>
    <li> Choose a company that is far from being fair, what size sample is needed for the power to be near 90%? </li>
    <li> How is the sample size related to the power of the test? </li>        
    <li> How is the degree to which the truth varies from the null hypothesis related to the power of the test? </li>    
    <li> Type II error is also presented. What is it's relation to power? Can you explain what a type II error is? </li>    
    <li> Choose the company that produced fair dice. Evaluate the power of the test for this company? Can you explain what you are seeing? </li>    
    
</ol>
